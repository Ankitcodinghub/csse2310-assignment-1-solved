The goal of this assignment is to give you practice at C programming. You will be building on this ability in the 2

remainder of the course (and subsequent programming assignments will be more difficult than this one). You 3

are to create a program (called uqwordiply) which allows users to play the Wordiply game (wordiply.com).

4

it operates. The assignment will also test your ability to code to a particular programming style guide, and to 6

use a revision control system appropriately. 7

Student Conduct 8

the assignment specification with fellow students, including on the discussion forum. In general, questions like 10

‚ÄúHow should the program behave if hthis happensi?‚Äù would be safe, if they are seeking clarification on the 11

specification. 12

You must not actively help (or seek help from) other students or other people with the actual design, structure 13

and/or coding of your assignment solution. It is cheating to look at another student‚Äôs assignment code 14

and it is cheating to allow your code to be seen or shared in printed or electronic form by others. 15

collusion, formal misconduct actions will be initiated against you, and those you cheated with. That‚Äôs right, if 17

you share your code with a friend, even inadvertently, then both of you are in trouble. Do not post your 18

code to a public place such as the course discussion forum or a public code repository. (Code in private posts 19

extensions so do not post your code to any public repository until at least three months after the result release 21

access your computer ‚Äì you must keep your code secure. Never leave your work unattended. 23

You must follow the following code referencing rules for all code committed to your SVN repository 24

(not just the version that you submit): 25

Code Origin Usage/Referencing

Code provided to you in writing this semester by CSSE2310/7231 teaching staff (e.g. code hosted on Black-

Code you have personally written in a previous enrolment in this course or in another ITEE course and where that code has not been shared or published.

Code (in any programming language) that you have taken inspiration from but have not copied .

Code Origin Usage/Referencing

26

many cooperate with us in misconduct investigations. 28

The teaching staff will conduct interviews with a subset of students about their submissions, for the purposes 29

of establishing genuine authorship. If you write your own code, you have nothing to fear from this process. If 30

you legitimately use code from other sources (following the usage/referencing requirements in the table above) 31

then you are expected to understand that code. If you are not able to adequately explain the design of your 32

solution and/or adequately explain your submitted code (and/or earlier versions in your repository) and/or 33

be able to make simple modifications to it as requested at the interview, then your assignment mark will be 34

subject to a misconduct investigation where your interview responses form part of the evidence. Failure to 36

submission (particularly from artificial intelligence tools) is likely to increase the probability of your selection 38

for an interview. 39

In short ‚Äì Don‚Äôt risk it! If you‚Äôre having trouble, seek help early from a member of the teaching staff. 40

Don‚Äôt be tempted to copy another student‚Äôs code or to use an online cheating service. Don‚Äôt help another 41

relationship. You should read and understand the statements on student misconduct in the course profile and 43

44

Specification 45

The uqwordiply game asks you to enter five words (guesses) that contain a given 3- or 4- letter combination of 46

letters (known as the starter word ). The goal is to enter valid words (based on some dictionary) that are as 47

long as possible. After entering the words, your score is reported as the sum of the lengths of the words entered, 48

and the longest possible word(s) from the dictionary are also reported. 49

You can choose to play the game with a particular starter word, or the game will choose a random one for 50

you. An example game play session is shown below. The command and guesses entered on standard input are 51

shown in bold green for clarity. Other lines are output to standard output. Note that the $ character is the 52

shell prompt ‚Äì it is not entered by the user nor output by uqwordiply. 53

Uploading or otherwise providing the assignment specification or part of it to a third party including online

Example 1: Example uqwordiply game session

$ ./uqwordiply

Welcome to UQWordiply!

The starter word is: TOP Enter words containing this word.

Enter guess 1: topographical Enter guess 2:

stopping Enter guess 3: topological Enter guess 4: utopian Enter guess 5: hilltop

Total length of words found: 46 Longest word(s) found:

TOPOGRAPHICAL (13)

Longest word(s) possible:

AMINOACETOPHENETIDINE (21)

MAGNETOPLASMADYNAMICS (21) $

Full details of the required behaviour are provided below. 54

Command Line Arguments 55

Your program (uqwordiply) is to accept command line arguments as follows: 56

./uqwordiply [‚Äìstart starter-word | ‚Äìlen length] [‚Äìdictionary filename] 57

The square brackets ([]) indicate optional arguments. The pipe symbol (|) indicates a choice ‚Äì i.e. in this 58 case either the ‚Äìstart or the ‚Äìlen option argument (with associated value) can be given but not both. The 59 italics indicate placeholders for user-supplied arguments. 60

Some examples of how the program might be run include the following : 61

./uqwordiply 62

./uqwordiply ‚Äìstart top 63 ./uqwordiply ‚Äìlen 3 64 ./uqwordiply ‚Äìdictionary mywords ‚Äìstart row 65 ./uqwordiply ‚Äìstart row ‚Äìdictionary ./mywords 66

67

Options can be in any order, as shown in the last two examples. 68

The meaning of the arguments is as follows: 69

‚Ä¢ ‚Äìstart ‚Äì if specified, this option argument is followed by a 3 or 4 letter starter word (combination of 70 letters, in uppercase, lowercase or mixed-case) to be used when playing the game. (This argument can 71 only be specified if the ‚Äìlen argument is not given.) 72

‚Ä¢ ‚Äìlen ‚Äì if specified, this option argument is followed by the number 3 or 4, to indicate the length of the 73 random starter word to be chosen. (This argument can only be specified if ‚Äìstart is not given.) 74

‚Ä¢ ‚Äìdictionary ‚Äì if specified, this option argument is followed by the name of a file that is to be used as 75 the dictionary of valid words. 76

If the ‚Äìstart argument is not supplied, then the program must choose a random starter word using the 77 supplied get_wordiply_starter_word() function ‚Äì see the Provided Library section on page 7. If the ‚Äìlen 78 argument is given then the random starter word must have that length. If the ‚Äìlen argument is not given, 79 then the random starter word can be either 3 or 4 letters long, i.e. 0 must be supplied as the argument to 80 get_wordiply_starter_word(). 81

If a dictionary filename is not specified, the default should be used (/usr/share/dict/words). 82

Prior to doing anything else, your program must check the command line arguments for validity. If the 83 program receives an invalid command line then it must print the message: 84

Usage:uqwordiply [‚Äìstart starter-word | ‚Äìlen length ] [‚Äìdictionary filename ]

Usage: uqwordiply [‚Äìstart starter-word | ‚Äìlen length] [‚Äìdictionary filename] 85 to standard error (with a following newline), and exit with an exit status of 1. 86

88

associated value argument. 89

‚Ä¢ Both the ‚Äìstart and ‚Äìlen option arguments (with associated values) are specified on the command 90

line. 91

‚Ä¢ The value associated with the ‚Äìlen argument is neither 3 nor 4. 92

‚Ä¢ Any of the option arguments are listed more than once (with associated values). Note that the command 93

line arguments ‚Äìstart ‚Äìstart would not be an invalid command line ‚Äì this would be an invalid starter 94

word error ‚Äì see below. 95

‚Ä¢ An unexpected argument is present. 96

Checking whether the starter-word and/or filename arguments (if present) are valid is not part of the usage 97

checking ‚Äì that is checked after command line validity ‚Äì see the next section. 98

Starter Word Checking 99

If the command line arguments are valid, and the ‚Äìstart argument is present with an associated value, then 100

the starter-word value must be checked for validity. If the value is invalid, then your program must print the 101

message: 102

uqwordiply: invalid starter word 103

to standard error (with a following newline), and exit with an exit status of 2. 104

Invalid starter words are: 105

‚Ä¢ those whose length is neither 3 nor 4, and/or 106

‚Ä¢ those that contain characters other than letters (uppercase and/or lowercase). 107

In other words, a valid starter word will be 3 or 4 letters long ‚Äì where those letters (A to Z) can be uppercase 108

or lowercase or a combination of both. 109

Dictionary File Name Checking 110

By default, your program is to use the dictionary file /usr/share/dict/words. If the ‚Äìdictionary argument 111

is supplied, then your program must instead use the dictionary whose filename is given as the value associated 112

with that option argument. If the given dictionary filename does not exist or can not be opened for reading, 113

your program must print the message: 114

uqwordiply: dictionary file ‚Äúfilename‚Äù cannot be opened 115

to standard error (with a following newline), and exit with an exit status of 3. (The italicised filename is 116

replaced by the actual filename, i.e. the value from the command line. The double quotes must be present.) 117

This check happens after the command line arguments and starter word (if supplied) are known to be valid. 118

The dictionary file is a text file where each line contains a ‚Äúword‚Äù. (Lines are terminated by a single newline 119

Program Operation 124

If the checks above are successful, then your program must determine a starter word if one is not given on the 125

command line. It does this by calling get_wordiply_starter_word() ‚Äì see details of this provided library 126

function on page 7. 127

Your program must then print the following to standard output (with a newline at the end of each line): 128

Welcome to UQWordiply! 129

The starter word is: STARTER 130

Enter words containing this word. 131

‚Ä¢ A valid option argument is given (i.e. ‚Äìstart, ‚Äìlen or ‚Äìdictionary) but it is not followed by an

STARTER 132

Your program must then repeatedly prompt the user for a guess by printing the following message to standard 133

output (with a following newline): 134

Enter guess N: 135

where N is replaced by the guess number (from 1 to 5 as appropriate). 136

Guesses are entered on standard input and are terminated by a newline (or pending EOF). The guess must 137

then be checked for validity ‚Äì with checks happening in the following order. 138

If the guess contains characters other than letters A to Z (can be any case, i.e. lowercase or uppercase), then 139

your program must print the following message to standard output (followed by a newline) and then re-prompt 140

for that guess: 141

Guesses must contain only letters ‚Äì try again. 142

If the guess does not contain the starter word (with letters of any case), then your program must print the 143

following message to standard output (followed by a newline) and then re-prompt for that guess: 144

Guesses must contain the starter word ‚Äì try again. 145

This same message is printed if the guess is the empty string. 146

If the guess is the starter word itself (with letters of any case), then your program must print the following 147

message to standard output (followed by a newline) and then re-prompt for that guess: 148

Guesses can‚Äôt be the starter word ‚Äì try again. 149

If the guess is an invalid word (i.e. can not be found in the dictionary with letters of any case), then your 150

program must print the following message to standard output (followed by a newline) and then re-prompt for 151

that guess: 152

Guess not found in dictionary ‚Äì try again. 153

If the guess is a valid word containing the starter word but you have previously guessed that word (with 154

letters of any case), then your program must print the following message to standard output (followed by a 155

newline) and then re-prompt for that guess: 156

You‚Äôve already guessed that word ‚Äì try again. 157

If a valid new word containing the starter word is entered, then your program must prompt for the next 158

word. Once five valid different words have been entered, or end-of-file (EOF ) is detected at the start of the 159

line when attempting to read a word, then your program must behave as follows. 160

If no valid guesses have been entered (e.g. EOF detected at the start of the line when reading the first 161

guess), then your program is to exit silently (no message is printed) with exit status 4. 162

If one or more valid guesses has been entered, then your program must print a blank line followed by the 163

following lines to standard output and then exit with exit status 0. 164

Total length of words found: N1 165

Longest word(s) found: 166

LONGWORD (N2) 167

Longest word(s) possible: 168

BESTWORD (N3) 169

N1 is replaced by the sum of the lengths of the valid guesses entered. LONGWORD (N2) is replaced by the 170

longest word that was guessed (printed in upper case), with its length in parentheses. If two or more words 171

are the equal longest then all words of that length are printed (in upper case, each with their length N2 in 172

parentheses). The order in which multiple words is printed is the same order in which there were entered. 173

BESTWORD (N3) is replaced by the longest valid word found in the dictionary that contains the starter word. 174

The word is printed in upper case, with its length (N3) in parentheses. If two or more words are the equal 175

longest then all words of that length are printed (in upper case, each with their length N3 in parentheses). The 176

order in which multiple words is printed is the same order in which they are found in the dictionary. (If the 177

word is present more than once in the dictionary then it is output multiple times.) 178

Other Requirements 179

Your program must open and read the dictionary file only once and store its contents (or a subset of its contents, 180

e.g. only words containing the starter word) in dynamically allocated memory. Your program must free all 181

allocated memory before exiting. 182

where is replaced by the 3 or 4 letter starter word (printed in upper case).

Example Game Sessions 183

Example 2: Example uqwordiply game session showing a variety of invalid guesses.

$ ./uqwordiply ‚Äìstart ism Welcome to UQWordiply!

The starter word is: ISM

Enter words containing this word. Enter guess 1: csse2310

Guesses must contain the starter word ‚Äì try again. Enter guess 1: ism

Guesses can‚Äôt be the starter word ‚Äì try again. Enter guess 1: teachism

Guess not found in dictionary ‚Äì try again. Enter guess 1: transcendentalism Enter guess 2: TRANSCENdentALISM

You‚Äôve already guessed that word ‚Äì try again. Enter guess 2:

UnProfessionalISM Enter guess 3:

POSTEXPRESSIONism Enter guess 4: anthropomorphisms Enter guess 5: antirepublicanism

Total length of words found: 85 Longest word(s) found: TRANSCENDENTALISM (17) UNPROFESSIONALISM (17) POSTEXPRESSIONISM (17) ANTHROPOMORPHISMS (17) ANTIREPUBLICANISM (17)

Longest word(s) possible:

ANTIDISESTABLISHMENTARIANISM (28) $

Example 3: Example uqwordiply game session showing multiple longest words.

$ ./uqwordiply ‚Äìstart tiES Welcome to UQWordiply!

The starter word is: TIES Enter words containing this word.

Enter guess 1: oddities Enter guess 2: twenties Enter guess 3: loftiest Enter guess 4: eighties

Enter guess 5: niceties

Total length of words found: 40 Longest word(s) found:

ODDITIES (8) TWENTIES (8) LOFTIEST (8) EIGHTIES (8) NICETIES (8)

Longest word(s) possible:

ARCHCONFRATERNITIES (19) CIRCUMSTANTIALITIES (19) IRRECONCILABILITIES (19) NONRESPECTABILITIES (19) NONRESPONSIBILITIES (19)

UNCONVENTIONALITIES (19)

$

The example below shows a blank line being input at the first prompt (i.e. no characters were present before 184 the newline). The first valid guess (governments) has been terminated by an EOF ‚Äì e.g. the user typed Ctrl-D 185 Ctrl-D after typing governments rather than typing a newline. This pending EOF terminated the word, and 186 when an attempt was made to read the next line (guess 2), the EOF was detected. 187

Example 4: Example uqwordiply game session ‚Äì with early termination.

$ ./uqwordiply

Welcome to UQWordiply!

The starter word is: MENT Enter words containing this word. Enter guess 1:

Guesses must contain the starter word ‚Äì try again. Enter guess 1: governmentsEnter guess 2:

Total length of words found: 11 Longest word(s) found:

GOVERNMENTS (11)

Longest word(s) possible:

ANTIDISESTABLISHMENTARIANISM (28) $

188

A library has been provided to you with the following function which your program must use (when no starter 189

word is provided on the command line): 190

const char* get_wordiply_starter_word(unsigned int wordLen); 191

The function is described in the get_wordiply_starter_word(3) man page on moss. (Run 192

man get_wordiply_starter_word.) 193

To use the library, you will need to add #include &lt;csse2310a1.h&gt; to your code and use the compiler flag 194

-I/local/courses/csse2310/include when compiling your code so that the compiler can find the include 195

file. You will also need to link with the library containing this function. To do this, use the compiler arguments 196

-L/local/courses/csse2310/lib -lcsse2310a1. 197

Provided Library: libcsse2310a1

198

Your program must follow version 2.3 of the CSSE2310/CSSE7231 C programming style guide available on the 199

course Blackboard site. Your submission must also comply with the Documentation required for the use of AI 200

tools if applicable. 201

Hints 202

1. The string representation of a single digit positive integer has a string length of 1. 203

toupper() and/or tolower(). Note that these functions operate on individual characters, represented as 205

integers (ASCII values). 206

strdup(), exit(), fopen(), fprintf(), and fgets(). You should consult the man pages for these 208

functions. 209

4. The style guide shows how you can break long string constants in C so as not to violate line length 210

requirements in the style guide. 211

can process more complicated combinations of command line arguments. See the getopt(3) man page for 215

details. Note that short forms of arguments are not to be supported, e.g. the arguments ‚Äú-s word‚Äù (for 216

specifying a starter word) should result in a usage error. To allow for the use of a getopt() family function, 217

we will not test your program‚Äôs behaviour with the argument ‚Äî (which is interpreted by getopt() as a 218

special argument that indicates the end of option arguments). We also won‚Äôt test abbreviated arguments, 219

e.g. ‚Äìstar, ‚Äìst, ‚Äìle etc. 220

Suggested Approach 221

It is suggested that you write your program using the following steps. Test your program at each stage and 222

commit to your SVN repository frequently. Note that the specification text above is the definitive description 223

of the expected program behaviour. The list below does not cover all required functionality. 224

1. Write a program that outputs the usage error message and exits with exit status 1. This small program 225

it thinks everything is a usage error! 227

2. Detect the presence of the ‚Äìlen command line argument and, if present, check the presence/validity of 228

the argument that follows it. Exit appropriately if not valid. 229

3. Detect the presence of the ‚Äìstart command line argument and, if present, check the presence/validity 230

of the argument that follows it. Exit appropriately if not valid. 231

4. Detect the presence of the ‚Äìdictionary command line argument and, if present, check the presence of 232

the argument that follows it. Exit appropriately if not valid. 233

5. Check whether the dictionary can be opened for reading or not. Exit appropriately if not. (If it can be 234

opened, leave it open ‚Äì you‚Äôll need to read from it next.) 235

6. Have your program print out the welcome message 236

7. Read the dictionary line by line, saving the words (or an appropriate subset of words) into dynamically 237

allocated memory. 238

8. Have your program repeatedly prompt for words (guesses). 239

Submission 252

Your submission must include all source and any other required files (in particular you must submit a Makefile). 253

Do not submit compiled files (eg .o, compiled programs) or dictionary files. 254

Your program (named uqwordiply) must build on moss.labs.eait.uq.edu.au with: 255

make 256

Your program must be compiled with gcc with at least the following options: 257

-pedantic -Wall -std=gnu99 258

than .c and .h files as part of the build process ‚Äì such files will be removed before building your program. 260

If any errors result from the make command (i.e. the uqwordiply executable can not be created) then you 261

Your program must not invoke other programs or use non-standard headers/libraries. 264

Your assignment submission must be committed to your subversion repository under 265

https://source.eait.uq.edu.au/svn/csse2310-sem1-sXXXXXXX/trunk/a1 266

where sXXXXXXX is your moss/UQ login ID. Only files at this top level will be marked so do not put source 267

will not be considered in marking ‚Äì they will not be checked out of your repository. 269

You must ensure that all files needed to compile and use your assignment (including a Makefile) are commit- 270

ted and within the trunk/a1 directory in your repository (and not within a subdirectory) and not just sitting 271

in your working directory. Do not commit compiled files or binaries. You are strongly encouraged to check out 272

a clean copy for testing purposes. 273

To submit your assignment, you must run the command 274

2310createzip a1 275

on moss and then submit the resulting zip file on Blackboard (a GradeScope submission link will be made 276

available in the Assessment area on the CSSE2310/7231 Blackboard site) . The zip file will be named 277

sXXXXXXX_csse2310_a1_timestamp.zip 278

where sXXXXXXX is replaced by your moss/UQ login ID and timestamp is replaced by a timestamp indicating 279

the time that the zip file was created. 280

The 2310createzip tool will check out the latest version of your assignment from the Subversion repository, 281

ensure it builds with the command ‚Äòmake‚Äô, and if so, will create a zip file that contains those files and your 282

Note that Gradescope will run the test suite immediately after you submit. When complete you will be 293

able to see the results of the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù tests. 294

to attend an interview about your assignment and you are unable to adequately respond to questions ‚Äì see the 297

Student conduct section above. 298

Provided your code compiles (see above) and does not use any prohibited statements/functions (see above), and 300

your zip file has been generated correctly and has not been modified prior to submission, then you will earn 301

for that feature, even if you claim to have implemented it. For example, if your program can never open 305

a dictionary file then we can not determine if your program can determine word validity correctly. If your 306

6. Program correctly plays game (and outputs final messages) with only valid guesses made 317

Tests for categories 2 and higher will take place with a variety of valid command lines. If your program doesn‚Äôt 321

detect a particular set of command line options as valid, or doesn‚Äôt handle a particular option (e.g. ‚Äìlen) or 322

are other dependencies between categories. For example, if your program doesn‚Äôt correctly print the welcome 324

Style Marking 326

Style marking is based on the number of style guide violations, i.e. the number of violations of version 2.3 of 327

You should pay particular attention to commenting so that others can understand your code. The marker‚Äôs 330

decision with respect to commenting violations is final ‚Äì it is the marker who has to understand your code. To 331

more than your functionality mark ‚Äì this prevents the submission of well styled programs which don‚Äôt meet at 333

least a minimum level of required functionality. 334

You are encouraged to use the style.sh tool installed on moss to style check your code before submission. 335

This does not check all style requirements, but it will determine your automated style mark (see below). Other 336

elements of the style guide are checked by humans. 337

All .c and .h files in your submission will be subject to style marking. This applies whether they are 338

compiled/linked into your executable or not . 339

.c and/or .h files are unable to be compiled by themselves then your automated style mark will be zero (0). 342

(Automated style marking can only be undertaken on code that compiles. The provided style.sh script checks 343

this for you.) 344

If your code does compile then your automated style mark will be determined as follows: Let 345

‚Ä¢ W be the total number of distinct compilation warnings recorded when your .c files are individually built 346

(using the correct compiler arguments) 347

‚Ä¢ A be the total number of style violations detected by style.sh when it is run over each of your .c and 348

.h files individually . 349

Your automated style mark S will be 350

S = 5 ‚àí (W + A) 351

penalised incorrectly then please bring this to the attention of the course coordinator and your mark can be 354

errors not picked up when you run style.sh on moss. This will not be considered a marking error ‚Äì it is your 356

responsibility to ensure that all of your code follows the style guide, even if styling errors are not detected in 357

some runs of style.sh. You can check the result of Gradescope style marking soon after your Gradescope 358

submission ‚Äì when its test suite completes running. 359

and ‚Äúother‚Äù. The meanings of words like appropriate and required are determined by the requirements in the 362

style guide. Note that functions longer than 50 lines will be penalised in the automated style marking. Functions 363

that are also longer than 100 lines will be further penalised here. 364

Mark Description

0 The majority (50%+) of comments present are inappropriate OR there are many required comments missing

0.5 The majority of comments present are appropriate AND the majority of required comments are present

1.0 The vast majority (80%+) of comments present are appropriate AND there are at most a few missing comments

1.5 All or almost all comments present are appropriate AND there are at most a few missing comments

2.0 Almost all comments present are appropriate AND there are no missing comments

2.5 All comments present are appropriate AND there are no missing comments

366

Naming (1 mark) 367

Mark Description

0 At least a few names used are inappropriate

0.5 Almost all names used are appropriate

1.0 All names used are appropriate

368

Mark Description

0 One or more functions is longer than 100 lines of code OR there is more than one global/static variable present inappropriately OR there is a global struct variable present inappropriately OR there are more than a few instances of poor modularity (e.g. repeated code)

0.5 All functions are 100 lines or shorter AND there is at most one inappropriate non-struct global/static variable AND there are at most a few instances of poor modularity

1.0 All functions are 100 lines or shorter AND there are no instances of inappropriate global/static variables AND there is no or very limited use of magic numbers AND there is at most one instance or poor modularity

1.5 All functions are 100 lines or shorter AND there are no instances of inappropriate global/static variables AND there is no use of magic numbers AND there are no instances of poor modularity

370

will be graded according to the following principles: 373

‚Ä¢ Appropriate use and frequency of commits (e.g. a single monolithic commit of your entire assignment will 374

yield a score of zero for this section) 375

‚Ä¢ Appropriate use of log messages to capture the changes represented by each commit. (Meaningful messages 376

explain briefly what has changed in the commit (e.g. in terms of functionality) and/or why the change 377

has been made and will be usually be more detailed for significant changes.) 378

The standards expected are outlined in the following rubric: 379

Mark

(out of 5) Description

0 Minimal commit history ‚Äì only one or two commits OR all commit messages are meaningless.

1 Some progressive development evident (three or more commits) AND at least one commit message is meaningful.

2 Progressive development is evident (multiple commits) AND at least half the commit messages are meaningful.

3 Multiple commits that show progressive development of ALL functionality (e.g. no large commits with multiple features in them) AND at least half the commit messages are meaningful.

4 Multiple commits that show progressive development of ALL functionality AND meaningful messages for all but one or two of the commits.

5 Multiple commits that show progressive development of ALL functionality AND meaningful messages for ALL commits.

and developing sound software engineering practices by documenting your changes as you go. In general, tiny 383

changes deserve small comments ‚Äì larger changes deserve more detailed commentary. 384

Total Mark 385

Let 386

‚Ä¢ F be the functionality mark for your assignment (out of 60). 387

‚Ä¢ S be the automated style mark for your assignment (out of 5). 388

‚Ä¢ H be the human style mark for your assignment (out of 5). 389

‚Ä¢ C be the SVN commit history mark (out of 5). 390

‚Ä¢ V is the scaling factor (0 to 1) determined after interview(s) (if applicable ‚Äì see the Student Conduct 391

section above) ‚Äì or 0 if you fail to attend a scheduled interview without having evidence of exceptional 392

circumstances impacting your ability to attend. 393

Your total mark for the assignment will be: 394

M = (F + min{F,S + H} + min{F,C}) √ó V 395

out of 75. 396

Pretty code that doesn‚Äôt work will not be rewarded! 398

Late Penalties 399

Late penalties will apply as outlined in the course profile. 400

Specification Updates 401

Any clarifications or updates to the assignment specification will be summarised here. Any updated versions 402

specification errors or omissions can be discussed on the discussion forum or emailed to csse2310@uq.edu.au. 404

405

‚Ä¢ Clarified other arguments we won‚Äôt test (to allow getopt() implementations) 407

‚Ä¢ Fixed typo in description of relationships between marking criteria 408

‚Ä¢ Fixed formatting error in usage message ‚Äì no spaces before closing square brackets 409

We understand that you are just getting to know Subversion, and you won‚Äôt be penalised for a few ‚Äútest
